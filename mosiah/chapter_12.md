**Mosiah 12:1** And it came to pass that after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and began again to prophesy among them, saying: Thus hath the Lord commanded me, saying: Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings. Therefore I will visit them in my anger; yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations;

**Mosiah 12:2** yea, woe be unto this generation. And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that this generation because of their iniquities shall be brought into bondage and shall be smitten on the cheek, yea, and shall be driven by men and shall be slain. And the vultures of the air and the dogs--yea, and the wild beasts--shall devour their flesh.

**Mosiah 12:3** And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot furnace, for he shall know that I am the Lord.

**Mosiah 12:4** And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence. And I will cause that they shall howl all the day long.

**Mosiah 12:5** Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon their backs, and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.

**Mosiah 12:6** And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten with the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also and devour their grain;

**Mosiah 12:7** and they shall be smitten with a great pestilence. And all this will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.

**Mosiah 12:8** And it shall come to pass that except they repent, I will utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth. Yet they shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for other nations which shall possess the land. Yea, even this will I do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other nations. And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.

**Mosiah 12:9** And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took him and carried him bound before the king and saith unto the king: Behold, we have brought a man before thee which has prophesied evil concerning thy people and saith that God will destroy them.

**Mosiah 12:10** And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life and saith that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.

**Mosiah 12:11** And again, he saith that thou shall be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is ran over by the beasts and trodden under foot.

**Mosiah 12:12** And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land. And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent--and this because of thine iniquities.

**Mosiah 12:13** And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done? Or what great sins has thy people committed that we should be condemned of God or judged of this man?

**Mosiah 12:14** And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless. And thou, O king, hast not sinned. Therefore this man hath lied concerning you, and he hath prophesied in vain.

**Mosiah 12:15** And behold, we are strong; we shall not come into bondage or be taken captive by our enemies. Yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper.

**Mosiah 12:16** Behold, here is the man. We deliver him into thy hands. Thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.

**Mosiah 12:17** And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast into prison. And he commanded that the priests should gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him.

**Mosiah 12:18** And it came to pass that they saith unto the king: Bring him hither that we may question him. And the king commanded that he should be brought before them.

**Mosiah 12:19** And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him. But he answered them boldly and withstood all their questions--yea, to their astonishment--for he did withstand them in all their questions and did confound them in all their words.

**Mosiah 12:20** And it came to pass that one of them saith unto him: What meaneth the words which are written and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:

**Mosiah 12:25** And now Abinadi saith unto them: Are you priests and pretend to teach this people and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desireth to know of me what these things mean?

**Mosiah 12:26** I say unto you: Woe be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord! For if ye understand these things, ye have not taught them. Therefore ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.

**Mosiah 12:27** Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore ye have not been wise. Therefore what teachest thou this people?

**Mosiah 12:28** And they said: We teach the law of Moses.

**Mosiah 12:29** And again he saith unto them: If ye teach the law of Moses, why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts upon riches? Why do ye commit whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord hath cause to send me to prophesy against this people?--yea, even a great evil against this people.

**Mosiah 12:30** Knowest thou not that I speak the truth? Yea, thou knowest that I speak the truth; and you had ought to tremble before God.

**Mosiah 12:32** And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law of Moses.

**Mosiah 12:33** But now Abinadi saith unto them: I know if ye keep the commandments of God, ye shall be saved--yea, if ye keep the commandments which the Lord delivered unto Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying:
