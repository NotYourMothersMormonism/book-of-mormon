*Ether 15:6* And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity.

*Ether 15:8* And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum, which by interpretation is large or to exceed all; wherefore when they came to these waters, they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents near unto them. And therefore on the morrow they did come to battle.

*Ether 15:15* And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and their children--both men, women, and children being armed with weapons of war, having shields and breastplates and headplates, and being clothed after the manner of war--and they did march forth one against another to battle; and they fought all that day and conquered not.

*Ether 15:16* And it came to pass that when it was night, they were weary and retired to their camps. And after that they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people. And so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations that it did rend the air exceedingly.

*Ether 15:17* And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle. And great and terrible was that day; nevertheless they conquered not.

*Ether 15:18* And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he would take the kingdom and spare the lives of the people.

*Ether 15:19* But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them. And Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds, that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.
