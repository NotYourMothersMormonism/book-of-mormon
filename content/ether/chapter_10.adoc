*Ether 10:1* And it came to pass that Shez, which was a descendant of Heth--for Heth had perished by the famine and all his household, save it were Shez--wherefore Shez began to build up again a broken people.

*Ether 10:2* And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom; for he remembered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother across the deep. And he did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he begat sons and daughters.

*Ether 10:3* And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did rebel against him. Nevertheless Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber because of his exceeding riches, which brought peace again unto his father.

*Ether 10:4* And it came to pass that his father did build up many cities upon the face of the land. And the people began again to spread over all the face of the land. And Shez did live to an exceeding old age, and he begat Riplakish; and he died, and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

*Ether 10:5* And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines and did lay that upon men's shoulders which was grievious to be borne. Yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes, and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.

*Ether 10:6* And he did erect him an exceeding beautiful throne. And he did build many prisons. And whoso would not be subject unto taxes he did cast into prison. And whoso were not able to pay taxes he did cast into prison. And he did cause that they should labor continually for their support. And whoso refused to labor he did cause to be put to death.

*Ether 10:7* Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work; yea, even his fine gold he did cause to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine workmanship he did cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass that he did afflict the people with his whoredoms and abominations.

*Ether 10:8* And when he had reigned for the space of forty and two years, the people did raise up in rebellion against him. And there began to be war again in the land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed and his descendants were driven out of the land.

*Ether 10:9* And it came to pass after the space of many years Morianton, he being a descendant of Riplakish, gathered together an army of outcasts and went forth and gave battle unto the people, and he gained power over many cities. And the war became exceeding sore and did last for the space of many years, and he did gain power over all the land and did establish himself king over all the land.

*Ether 10:10* And after that he had established himself king, he did ease the burden of the people, in the which he did gain favor in the eyes of the people; and they did anoint him to be their king.

*Ether 10:11* And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself because of his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the presence of the Lord.

*Ether 10:12* And it came to pass that Morianton built up many cities. And the people became exceeding rich under his reign, both in buildings and in gold and in silver and in raising grain and in flocks and herds and such things which had been restored unto them.

*Ether 10:13* And Morianton did live to an exceeding great age, and then he begat Kim. And Kim did reign in the stead of his father, and he did reign eight years and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did not reign in righteousness; wherefore he was not favored of the Lord.

*Ether 10:14* And his brother did raise up in rebellion against him, in the which he did bring him into captivity. And he did remain in captivity all his days, and he begat sons and daughters in captivity. And in his old age he begat Levi, and he died.

*Ether 10:15* And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity, after the death of his father, for the space of forty and two years. And he did make war against the king of the land, in the which he did obtain unto himself the kingdom.

*Ether 10:16* And after that he had obtained unto himself the kingdom, he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord. And the people did prosper in the land. And he did live to a good old age and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he anointed king in his stead.

*Ether 10:17* And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the sight of the Lord all his days; and he begat many sons and daughters. And after that he had seen many days, he did pass away, even like unto the rest of the earth, and Kish reigned in his stead.

*Ether 10:18* And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib reigned in his stead.

*Ether 10:19* And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the Lord. And in the days of Lib the poisonous serpents were destroyed. Wherefore they did go into the land southward to hunt food for the people of the land, for the land was covered with animals of the forest; and Lib also himself became a great hunter.

*Ether 10:20* And they built a great city by the narrow neck of land, by the place where the sea divides the land.

*Ether 10:21* And they did preserve the land southward for a wilderness to get game. And the whole face of the land northward was covered with inhabitants.

*Ether 10:22* And they were exceeding industrious, and they did buy and sell and traffic one with another that they might get gain.

*Ether 10:23* And they did work in all manner of ore, and they did make gold and silver and iron and brass and all manner of metals; and they did dig it out of the earth. Wherefore they did cast up mighty heaps of earth for to get ore, of gold and of silver and of iron and of copper. And they did work all manner of fine work.

*Ether 10:24* And they did have silks and fine-twined linen; and they did work all manner of cloth that they might clothe themselves from their nakedness.

*Ether 10:25* And they did make all manner of tools to till the earth, both to plow and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.

*Ether 10:26* And they did make all manner of tools, in the which they did work their beasts.
