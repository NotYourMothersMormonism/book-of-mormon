*1 Nephi 2:1* For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and saith unto him: [highlight-orange]#Blessed art thou Lehi# because of the things which thou hast done. And because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

*1 Nephi 2:2* And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.

*1 Nephi 2:3* And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord; wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.

*1 Nephi 2:4* And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house and the land of his inheritance and his gold and his silver and his precious things and took nothing with him save it were his family and provisions and tents, and he departed into the wilderness.

*1 Nephi 2:5* And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea, and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which was nearer the Red Sea.

*1 Nephi 2:6* And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley beside a river of water.
