*1 Nephi 22:1* And now it came to pass that after I Nephi--after that I had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What mean these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are spiritual which shall come to pass according to the Spirit and not the flesh?

*1 Nephi 22:2* And I Nephi saith unto them: Behold, they were made manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit, for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the prophets which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.

*1 Nephi 22:3* Wherefore the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual. For it appears that the house of Israel sooner or later will be scattered upon all the face of the earth and also among all nations.

*1 Nephi 22:4* And behold, there are many which are already lost from the knowledge of they which are at Jerusalem; yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led away, and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea. And whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.

*1 Nephi 22:5* And since that they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all they which shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded because of the Holy One of Israel, for against him will they harden their hearts. Wherefore they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be hated by all men.
