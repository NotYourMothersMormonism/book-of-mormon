*1 Nephi 11:1* For it came to pass that after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, wherefore as I sat pondering in mine heart, I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high mountain, a mountain which I never had before seen and upon which I never had before sat my foot.

*1 Nephi 11:2* And the Spirit saith unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?

*1 Nephi 11:4* And the Spirit saith unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?

*1 Nephi 11:5* And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.

And blessed art thou Nephi because thou believest in the Son of the Most High; wherefore thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.

[The tree] was exceedingly handsome, insomuch that I looked upon it with wonder and admiration. Its beautiful branches spread themselves somewhat like an umbrella, and it bore a kind of fruit, in shape much like a chestnut bur, and as white as snow, or, if possible whiter ... the fruit which they contained, which was of dazzling whiteness

*1 Nephi 11:8* And it came to pass that the Spirit saith unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree, and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen.

I beheld a beautiful stream of water, which ran from the east to the west. Of this stream I could see neither the source nor yet the termination; but as far as my eyes could extend I could see a rope running along the bank of it, about as high as a man could reach, and beyond me was a low, but very pleasant valley, in which stood a tree such as I had never seen before

After feasting in this manner a short time, I asked my guide what was the meaning of the spacious building which I saw. He replied, 'It is Babylon, it is Babylon, and it must fall. The people in the doors and windows are the inhabitants thereof, who scorn and despise the Saints of God because of their humility.'
