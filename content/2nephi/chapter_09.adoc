*2 Nephi 9:1* And now my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord, that he hath covenanted with all the house of Israel,

*2 Nephi 9:2* that he hath spoken unto the Jews by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down from generation to generation until the time cometh that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God, when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance and shall be established in all their lands of promise.

*2 Nephi 9:3* Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice and lift up your heads forever because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.

*2 Nephi 9:7* Wherefore it must needs be an [highlight]#infinite atonement#; save it should be an infinite atonement, [highlight-orange]#this corruption could not put on incorruption#. Wherefore the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.

*2 Nephi 9:8* O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more, our spirits must become subject to that angel which fell from before the presence of the Eternal God and became the devil, to rise no more.

*2 Nephi 9:9* And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil--to be shut out from the presence of our God and to remain with the father of lies, in misery like unto himself--yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.

*2 Nephi 9:10* O how great the goodness of our God who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster! Yea, that monster death and hell which I call the death of the body and also the death of the spirit.

*2 Nephi 9:13* O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the bodies of the righteous. And the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible and immortal; and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.

*2 Nephi 9:14* Wherefore we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt and our uncleanness and our nakedness. And the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.

*2 Nephi 9:19* O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster, the devil and death and hell and that lake of fire and brimstone which is endless torment.

*2 Nephi 9:20* O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not any thing save he know it.

*2 Nephi 9:21* And he cometh into the world that he may save all men, if they will hearken unto his voice. For behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men women and children, which belong to the family of Adam.

*2 Nephi 9:22* And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.

*2 Nephi 9:23* And he commandeth all men that they must repent and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.

*2 Nephi 9:24* And if they will not repent and believe in his name and be baptized in his name and endure to the end, they must be damned, for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, hath spoken it.

*2 Nephi 9:25* Wherefore he hath given a law. And where there is no law given there is no punishment, and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation, and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the Holy One of Israel hath claim upon them because of the atonement, for they are delivered by the power of him.

*2 Nephi 9:26* For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who hath not the law given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell and the devil and the lake of fire and brimstone which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel.

*2 Nephi 9:27* But woe unto him that hath the law given, yea, that hath all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state.

*2 Nephi 9:28* O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness and the frailties and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves. Wherefore their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not; wherefore they shall perish.

Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness, but the righteous fear it not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.

And there is none other way save it be by the gate, for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.

I transgressed thy law and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.
