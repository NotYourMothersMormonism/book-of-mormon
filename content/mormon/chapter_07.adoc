*Mormon 7:1* And now behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of this people which are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers. Yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel. And this is the words which I speak:

*Mormon 7:2* Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.

*Mormon 7:3* Know ye that ye must come unto repentance or ye cannot be saved.

*Mormon 7:4* Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war and delight no more in the shedding of blood and take them not again, save it be that God shall command you.
