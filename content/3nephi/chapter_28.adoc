*3 Nephi 28:1* And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake unto his disciples one by one, saying unto them: What is it that ye desire of me after that I am gone to the Father?

*3 Nephi 28:2* And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We desire that after we have lived unto the age of man that our ministry wherein thou hast called us may have an end, that we may speedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.

*3 Nephi 28:3* And he saith unto them: Blessed are ye because ye desire this thing of me. Therefore after that ye are seventy and two years old, ye shall come unto me in my kingdom, and with me ye shall find rest.

*3 Nephi 28:4* And when he had spake unto them, he turned himself unto the three and said unto them: What will ye that I should do unto you when I am gone unto the Father?

*3 Nephi 28:5* And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak unto him the thing which they desired.

20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?

22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.

23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

*3 Nephi 28:16* But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the face of the earth. Nevertheless they did not minister of the things which they had heard and seen because of the commandment which was given them in heaven.

*3 Nephi 28:17* And now whether they were mortal or immortal from the day of their transfiguration, I know not.

*3 Nephi 28:18* But this much I know, according to the record which hath been given, they did go forth upon the face of the land and did minister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching, baptizing them; and as many as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.

*3 Nephi 28:20* And they were cast down into the earth, but they did smite the earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they were delivered out of the depths of the earth. And therefore they could not dig pits sufficiently to hold them.

*3 Nephi 28:21* And thrice they were cast into a furnace and received no harm.

*3 Nephi 28:22* And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts, and behold, they did play with the beasts as a child with a suckling lamb and received no harm.

*3 Nephi 28:23* And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the people of Nephi and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land, and they were converted unto the Lord and were united unto the church of Christ. And thus the people of that generation were blessed according to the word of Jesus.

*3 Nephi 28:24* And now I Mormon make an end of speaking concerning these things for a time.

*3 Nephi 28:31* Therefore great and marvelous works shall be wrought by them before the great and coming day when all people must surely [highlight-orange]#stand before the judgment seat of Christ.#

*3 Nephi 28:32* Yea, even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvelous work wrought by them before that judgment day.

*3 Nephi 28:33* And if ye had all the scriptures which gives an account of all the marvelous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ, know that these things must surely come.

*3 Nephi 28:34* And woe be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of Jesus and also to them which he hath chosen and sent among them. For whoso receiveth not the words of Jesus and the words of them which he hath sent receiveth not him, and therefore he will not receive them at the last day.

*3 Nephi 28:35* And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God who hath been trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?

*3 Nephi 28:36* And now behold, as I spake concerning them whom the Lord had chosen--yea, even three which were caught up into the heavens--that I knew not whether they were changed from mortality to immortality--

*3 Nephi 28:37* but behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord; and he hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a change wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of death.

*3 Nephi 28:38* Therefore that they might not taste of death, there was a change wrought upon their bodies that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow, save it were for the sins of the world.

*3 Nephi 28:39* Now this change was not equal to that which should take place at the last day, but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could not tempt them. And they were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy and that the powers of the earth could not hold them.

*3 Nephi 28:40* And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ. And at that day they were to receive a greater change and to be received into the kingdom of the Father, to go no more out but to dwell with God eternally in the heavens.
