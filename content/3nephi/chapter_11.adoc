*3 Nephi 11:1* And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together of the people of Nephi round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful. And they were marveling and wondering one with another and were shewing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.

*3 Nephi 11:2* And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ of which the sign had been given concerning his death.

*3 Nephi 11:3* And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven. And they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard. And it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice. Nevertheless--and notwithstanding it being a small voice--it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there were no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake. Yea, it did pierce them to the very soul and did cause their hearts to burn.

*3 Nephi 11:4* And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.

*3 Nephi 11:5* And again the third time they did hear the voice and did open their ears to hear it. And their eyes were towards the sound thereof, and they did look steadfastly towards heaven from whence the sound came.

And they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.

*3 Nephi 11:9* And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:
