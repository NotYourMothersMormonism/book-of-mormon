*3 Nephi 15:8* For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people is not all fulfilled, but the law which was given unto Moses hath an end in me.

*3 Nephi 15:12* Ye are my disciples, and ye are a light unto this people, which are a remnant of the house of Joseph.

*3 Nephi 15:13* And behold, this is the land of your inheritance, and the Father hath given it unto you.

*3 Nephi 15:23* And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice. And they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice, that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.

*3 Nephi 15:24* But behold, ye have both heard my voice and seen me, and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among them which the Father hath given me.
