*Helaman 5:1* And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.

*Helaman 5:2* For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of the people and they which chose evil were more numerous than they which chose good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.

*Helaman 5:3* Yea, and this was not all. They were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice save it were to their destruction.

*Helaman 5:4* And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment seat and took it upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also all the remainder of his days.

*Helaman 5:5* For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words which he spake:

*Helaman 5:6* Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God. And I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents which came out of the land of Jerusalem. And this I have done that when you remember your names that ye may remember them. And when ye remember them, ye may remember their works. And when ye remember their works, ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.

*Helaman 5:7* Therefore my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.

Yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.

*Helaman 5:11* And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repentance. Therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.

*Helaman 5:13* And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons. Yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written;

*Helaman 5:14* and they did remember his words. And therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful,

*Helaman 5:15* and from thenceforth to the city of Gid, and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek,

*Helaman 5:16* and even from one city to another until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi which were in the land southward, and from thence into the land of Zarahemla among the Lamanites.

*Helaman 5:17* And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters which had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.

*Helaman 5:18* And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak. And they also had what they should speak given unto them.

*Helaman 5:19* Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites which were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.

*Helaman 5:20* And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.

*Helaman 5:21* And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into prison, yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.

*Helaman 5:22* And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them, that they might slay them.

*Helaman 5:23* And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.

*Helaman 5:24* And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage;

*Helaman 5:25* for they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them, neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement.

*Helaman 5:26* And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not! For behold, it is God that hath shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shewn unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.
