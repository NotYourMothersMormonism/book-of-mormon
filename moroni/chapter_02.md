**Moroni 2:1** The words of Christ which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them.

**Moroni 2:2** And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name in mighty prayer. And after that ye have done this, ye shall have power that on him whom ye shall lay your hands ye shall give the Holy Ghost. And in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.

**Moroni 2:3** Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing. And the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it. And on as many as they laid their hands fell the Holy Ghost.
