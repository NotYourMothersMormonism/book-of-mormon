# Book of Mormon Origins

## The Internet Annotated Book of Mormon

Welcome to our project to crowd source the origins of the Book of Mormon, a controversial text published in 1830. 

The objective is not to find the “most correct” meaning for each passage of the Book of Mormon, but to find the most likely sources which Joseph Smith [remixed](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) to create the Book of Mormon.

### The Remix Hypothesis

According to modern research, The Book of Mormon was probably not plagiarized directly from hundreds of sources. The book required creativity (a form of remixing) to produce, and as with any other creative work, The Book of Mormon appears to be heavily influenced by its time and place in history. The Remix Hypothesis holds that without certain foundational texts and cultural influences preceding the 1830 publication of The Book of Mormon, it simply would not exist in its current form. Feel free to browse the sources, and add your comments. 

### Which version of The Book of Mormon do we use?

We’ve selected the *1830 First Edition* of the Book of Mormon. We fully acknowledge that this won’t match the current LDS version of the Book of Mormon because it has been updated by numerous LDS leaders since 1830. However the 1830 edition is more likely to match the original sources.
