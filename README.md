# Book of Mormon Origins

## The Internet Annotated Book of Mormon

Welcome to our project to crowd source the origins of the Book of Mormon. 

The objective is not to find the “most correct” meaning for each passage of the Book of Mormon, but to find the most likely sources which Joseph Smith [remixed](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) to create the Book of Mormon.

### Which version of The Book of Mormon do we use?

As the basis for this project, we’ve selected the *1830 First Edition* of the Book of Mormon. This edition is likely to be the closest to the original sources. We fully acknowledge that this won’t match the current published version of the Book of Mormon; however, the current version as published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been updated by numerous LDS leaders since 1830.
