# Book of Mormon Origins

## The Internet Annotated Book of Mormon

Welcome to our project to crowd source the origins of the Book of Mormon. This is a collaborative project and we request basic respect.

As the basis for this project, we’ve selected the *1830 First Edition* of the Book of Mormon. This edition likely to be closest to the original sources. We fully acknowledge that this won’t match the current published version of the Book of Mormon; however, the current version as published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been updated by numerous LDS leaders since 1830.

The objective is not to find the “most correct” version of the Book of Mormon, but to instead provide the sources which Joseph Smith [remixed](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) to create the Book of Mormon.

If you are a believing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you may find this information disturbing.

If you’d like to contribute to this work, please register as a user and begin annotating! If you have written a post somewhere else that explains how a verse was created, feel free to provide a 2 sentence summary and then link to your post! This is a community effort.

## Annotation Requirements

Each annotation must include the following:

* Quote
* Source title
* Date source published
* Link if available
* If you need storage for video/images hosting of content is available on this site

## Table of Contents

The [Table of Contents](README.md) is available at the panel on the left-hand side of the screen.

## Generating the Text

If you'd like to create a similar project and have some knowledge of programming and the Linux command-line, you may be interested in the following.

You can generate the source text of this book in its unannotated form (i.e. as a series of text files) using the `gen.sh` command included in this repository. Here is a basic outline of the steps necessary to generate the text files:

* Install Ruby
* Install [bomdb](https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb), a command-line tool for querying, diffing, and generating portions of text from the Book of Mormon
* Run the `gen.sh` command in this repository
